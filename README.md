# web-contactlist

 - [Live Demo Here!](https://space-hound.github.io/web-contactlist/)

I made this for a colleague of mine, as "his homework" for a class. I literally made it in 135 minutes without any library or framework and with breaks. It is just the front end for a contact list app, where you can add, edit and remove contacts (name, email and phone). Honestly there is nothing interesting at this repository, only the fact that I am proud of the time it took me to make it.
